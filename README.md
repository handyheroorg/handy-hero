# Handy Hero Documentation

## Introduction
Handy Hero is a platform designed to connect service providers with homeowners, facilitating various home services. It prioritizes transparency in cost and service quality by enabling direct interaction between service providers and homeowners. The platform features customer ratings and feedback mechanisms, ensuring mutual benefits for both parties. Moreover, Handy Hero streamlines payment processes by integrating with the Square API, thereby ensuring transparency in financial transactions.

## Overview
Handy Hero utilizes a modern tech stack to deliver its services. The backend is built using NestJS, MongoDB, and Prisma, while the frontend is developed with React (Vite), ReactQuery, and Tailwind CSS. The integration with Square API enables seamless payment processing between customers and service providers.

## Features Implemented
- **User Authentication:** Implemented a signup and login functionality for both clients and service providers.
- **Client Dashboard:** Allows clients to search for services in their area, discover service providers, view ratings, and contact them.
- **Service Provider Profile:** Displays comprehensive information about service providers, including years of experience, average service cost, ratings, previous work, customer reviews, education, and profession.
- **Payment Integration:** Utilizes Square API for transparent payment processing from customers to service providers.

### Challenges Faced

- Technical Challenges:

1. Integrating the Square API for payment processing required careful handling of financial transactions and ensuring compliance with payment regulations.
2. Implementing a seamless user experience while maintaining transparency in service costs and quality posed challenges in UI/UX design and system architecture.

- Operational Challenges:

1. **Maintaining Confidentiality:** Ensuring the confidentiality of customer contact information while facilitating communication with service providers posed a challenge. To address this, we plan to introduce a chat feature in the near future, allowing clients to contact service providers without revealing personal information unless necessary.
   
2. **Prompt Service Provider Response:** Ensuring prompt responses from service providers to customer requests proved to be a significant challenge. To overcome this, we implemented NOVU for providing notifications to service providers whenever a client requested their service, ensuring timely communication and response.

3. **Ensuring Safety for Service Providers:** Creating a safe environment for service providers within the platform was a key concern. To address this, we implemented a rating system where service providers can also rate customers. If a customer receives negative ratings, they will not be matched with the same service provider for a month. Additionally, customers with multiple negative ratings may be blacklisted, ensuring a fair and respectful environment for service providers.

### Challenges Overcome
- Integrating the Square API for payment processing required careful handling of financial transactions and ensuring compliance with payment regulations.
- Implementing a seamless user experience while maintaining transparency in service costs and quality posed challenges in UI/UX design and system architecture.
